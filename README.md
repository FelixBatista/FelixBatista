# HI THERE ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a maker interested on developing things: all sort of things - from woodworking to IoT. For me there is always a purpose to any tool and it's our job to find.
I use my github to save my work while bulding stuff.

- ðŸ›  I graduated on Mechatonics
- ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m currently working on BMW as a Quality Analyst
